# BETFAIR JSON API #



## Contribute ##
Betfair is currently building out its new API based on RESTful JSON approach.

If you wish to contribute please for this repo, add any API calls or helper methods that you like.

Please make sure they are well tested and give me a pull request.

You will need to email bdp@betfair.com asking for an application key to access the JSON version of the API.
